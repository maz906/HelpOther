7/19/2014:
- compiled into executable using cx_freeze 4.4
- required changing raw_input() to input()
- "mess up" safety checks are not perfect
- must ensure that the results file is not in the directory

Currently:
- reads all csv files in the given directory
- asks for what file name to save data to
- gets the second column of each csv file (hard-coded)
- probably inefficient
- functional

Changes (to do):
- give the option to pick a column
- give the option to pick a column for each file
- run through python profiler
